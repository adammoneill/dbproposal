%\begin{abstract}
%ent results have resolved functional encryption for all circuits. Does this solve most problems for functional encryption. We think not. In this paper we present the future vision for functional encryption. Our vision for functional encryption is to realize encryption systems which (at least asymptotically) approach the efficiency levels approached in insecure solutions.

\subsection{Component A-II:  Property-Preserving Encryption for Time Series Data} 

In time series data one is often interested in correlations and anomalies.  Accordingly, we propose to look at \emph{correlation revealing and preserving encryption}  (CRE and CPE) and \emph{anomaly revealing and preserving encryption} (ARE and APE).  In other words, in the ``preserving'' case we are interested in perturbing statistical data in a way that preserves statistics or the fact that a point is an anomaly.  

Regarding correlation revealing schemes
\begin{question}
Can we design efficient CPE for correlations of interest?  Which correlations should we target?  What security can be achieved by such schemes?
\end{question}


\begin{question}
Can we design efficient CRE with better security?
\end{question}

\begin{question}
Can we design ``partial'' CPE with better security?
\end{question}


Regarding anomaly  evealing schemes
\begin{question}
Can we design efficient APE?  How should anomaly thresholds be set?  What security can be achieved by such schemes?
\end{question}


\begin{question}
Can we design efficient ARE with better security?
\end{question}

\begin{question}
Can we design ``partial'' APE with better security?
\end{question}

\subsection{Component A-III:  Property-Preserving Encryption for Graph Data} 

For graph data, shortest path and disease propagation queries are common.  Previous work looks at supporting shortest path queries in the context of searchable symmetric encryption.  Accordingly, we propose to investigate \emph{shortest path revealing  and preserving encryption} (SPRE and SPPE) and \emph{random walk revealing and preserving encryption} (RWRE and RWPE).   We believe that the study of such encryption schemes will lead to interesting questions in graph theory.  We will particularly try to leverage work on differentially private graph sanitization. 

Regarding shortest path revealing schemes: 

\begin{question}
Can we design efficient SPPE?  What security can be achieved by such schemes?
\end{question}


\begin{question}
Can we design efficient SPRE with better security?
\end{question}

\begin{question}
Can we design ``partial'' SPPE with better security?
\end{question}

And then regarding random walk preserving schemes:

\begin{question}
Can we design efficient RWPE?  What security can be achieved by such schemes?
\end{question}


\begin{question}
Can we design efficient RWRE with better security?
\end{question}

\begin{question}
Can we design ``partial'' RWPE with better security?
\end{question}

\section{Prior Accomplishments and NSF Support}

\paragraph{Adam O'Neill:}
In his Ph.D.~work, the PI  developed the notions of deterministic encryption~\cite{C:BelBolONe07,Amanatidis2007,C:BolFehONe08,C:BFOR08,TCC:FulNeiRey12} and order-preserving encryption~\cite{EC:BCLO09,C:BolCheONe11} to help enable search on encrypted data with processing time comparable to that for unencrypted data, while providing as-strong-as-possible security guarantees subject to this constraint.
The PI has also worked on  instantiating random oracles~\cite{C:KilOneSmi10,TCC:GoyONeRao11,EC:LewONeSmi13},   aggregate signatures~\cite{CCS:BGOY07,AC:GLOW12}, deniable encryption~\cite{C:OnePeiWat11},  chosen-ciphertext security~\cite{EC:KilMohOne10,PKC:DFMO14}, and  functional encryption~\cite{EPRINT:ONeill10b,C:DIJOPP13, CANS:BelONe13}.   %Furthermore, he collaborated with database faculty George Kollios on refinements to order-preserving encryption~\cite{}.
Since joining Georgetown, he has also been working on  applications of indistinguishability obfuscation~\cite{PKC:DGLOZ16} and on integrating cryptography with emerging applications, such as outsourced database systems using modular order-preserving encryption~\cite{mavroforakis2015modular} and  privacy preserving network provenance using structured encryption~\cite{zhang2017privacy}.


Prior support: ``EAGER: Guaranteed-Secure and Searchable Genomic Data Repositories.'' (PI). Proposal Number 1650419.  2016 - 2017. \$99,9999.
``Program Obfuscation: From Theory to Practice." NSF Research Experiences for Undergraduates Supplement (PI).
Supplement to Award \#IIP-1362046,   2014 - 2019, \$8,000.

\paragraph{Benjamin Fuller:}
In his Ph.D.~work, the co-PI worked on deterministic encryption with Dr. O'Neill \cite{TCC:FulNeiRey12,JC:FulONeRey15}.  His main focus was on cryptography with noise developing new fuzzy extractors~\cite{AC:FulMenRey13,AC:FulReySmi16,EC:CFPRS16}.  Fuzzy extractors can be thought of as a special case of distance preserving encryption where only a single point is comparable.  He then oversaw evaluation and implementation of encrypted search systems at MIT Lincoln Laboratory as part of the IARPA SPAR project~\cite{spar_baa} including BlindSeer codeveloped by Dr. Choi.  Since joining the University of Connecticut in 2016, his work has focused on driving cryptography to practice including authentication and fuzzy extractors~\cite{EPRINT:HFDD17,EPRINT:BKFY17,EPRINT:ABCFG16}, secure outsourced databases~\cite{SP:FVYSHG17}, and multi-party computation~\cite{EPRINT:CunFulYak16}.  

Prior NSF support: not applicable.

\paragraph{Seung Geol Choi:}
The co-PI is mainly interested in achieving privacy in practice. As for the
works directly related to this proposal, he participated in the IARPA SPAR
project~\cite{spar_baa} as a member of the team of Columbia University and Bell
Labs to build the BlindSeer system~\cite{SP:PKVKMC14}, and he also recently
introduced a new system, called POPE, that supports range queries over
encrypted data~\cite{CCS:RACY16}.  

He has also worked on topics related to this proposal such as
ORAMs~\cite{SP:RocAviCho16,NDSS:ACMR17,CCS:RACM17}, secure multi-party
computation~\cite{AC:CEJMY07,TCC:CDMW09,AC:CEMY09,RSA:CHKMR12,TCC:CKKZ12,PKC:CKWZ13,C:CKMZ14,TCC:CKSYZ14},
and various encryption schemes~\cite{TCC:CDMW08,AC:CDMW09,AC:LCLPY13}. 

Prior NSF support: ``RUI: Achieving Practical Privacy for the Cloud.'' (co-PI) Award number 1618269, 2016-2019, \$355K. 

\paragraph{Daniel S.\ Roche:}
This co-PI comes from an algorithms background, having worked
extensively in the area of computer algebra and publishing frequently in
the top venues of that area
\cite{Roc09,Roc11,GR10,GR11,GR11a,GRT10,GRT12,HR10,AGR14,AR14,AGR15}. Recently, his interests have turned to
developing improved algorithms and data structures for ensuring privacy
in remote storage, which is closely related to the topic of this
proposal
\cite{SP:RocAviCho16,CCS:RACY16,NDSS:ACMR17,CCS:RACM17}.

The co-PI has a proven track record of working with undergraduates and
graduate students at other institutions,
including multiple publications from such collaborations
\cite{AGR13,AGR14,AGR15,AR14,KRT15,GR16}.

Prior NSF support: ``AF: Small: RUI: Faster Arithmetic for Sparse
Polynomials and Integers.'' (PI) Award number 1319994, 2013-2016, \$123K.

Prior NSF support: ``RUI: Achieving Practical Privacy for the Cloud.''

\section{Schedule and Management Plan}
The work described in this proposal will be performed by a combination of the PIs, graduate students at Georgetown University and University of Connecticut, and undergraduate students at all three institutions.  A collaboration plan is attached as supplementary material.  In this section, we provide a brief overview of the timeline of the proposed research.  For each task, we have identified the lead PI for that task but we expect all tasks to involve collaboration between all PIs.  The work is summarized in Table~\ref{tab:work}.
