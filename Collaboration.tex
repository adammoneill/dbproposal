\title{SaTC: CORE: Small: Next Generation Outsourced Databases \\Collaboration Plan}

\maketitle

This proposal lays out research between three institutions: Georgetown University, University of Connecticut and the United States Naval Academy.  We first note that Georgetown and the Naval Academy are approximately a one hour drive.  University of Connecticut is a one hour flight to the DC metro area. Dr. Fuller and Dr. O'Neill have worked together regularly over the last five years and have a good working relationship.  In addition, Dr. Fuller evaluated the BLIND SEER project developed by Dr. Choi.  Dr. Choi and Dr. Roche are frequent collaborators coauthoring two papers together in 2016.  To ensure successful project collaboration the following steps will be followed:

\begin{enumerate}
\item All four co-PIs will have a standing bimonthly call to discuss project status and research directions.  Participating students will also engage in this call.
\item Dr. Fuller and the graduate student at the University of Connecticut will travel to the DC metro area for two weeks a year for focused work with the other PIs.  This meeting will also serve as a internal project review meeting for the project.
\item The PIs will encourage graduate students (from Georgetown and University of Connecticut) to spend at least one summer at a partner institution.
\end{enumerate}
