\paragraph{Motivation.}
%The growth of data volume is outpacing organizations' ability to manage and
%organize this data. Organizations are turning to external cloud providers to
%manage their data needs.  In the information age, this data is many online
%businesses most valuable asset.  This migration presents a serious risk: can
%cloud providers be trusted to maintain confidentiality of the data?  Encryption
%can preserve confidentiality at the cost of removing the data' organization.
%However, the very utility of the stored data derives from the ability to
%quickly query, process, and derive insights.  Ideally, we could use more
%sophisticated cryptography to create databases capable of efficiently answering
%a client's queries without revealing information to the server.

The growth of data volume is outpacing organizations' ability to manage and
organize this data, and organizations are turning to external cloud providers
to manage their data needs.  
%
This migration presents a challenge of maintaining confidentiality of their
valuable data asset, so the data is often outsourced in an encrypted from. 
%
However, employing encryption comes at the cost of disabling the cloud server
from {\em quickly processing the data in the plaintext form and answering
complex queries from the client}. 
%
Ideally, we could use more sophisticated cryptography to {\em create databases
capable of efficiently answering a client's queries without revealing
information to the cloud server}.  

\paragraph{Previous works.}
Two research threads have focused on closing this gap.
%(collectively known as
%searchable encryption).  
Property-preserving encryption creates symmetric encryption techniques
compatible with an unprotected database. Examples include deterministic
encryption which can answer equality queries and order-preserving encryption
which can answer range queries. Academic teams, start-up companies, and Fortune
500 companies all offer variants of property-preserving encryption.
%Recent attacks against these schemes indicate even ideal property-preserving
%encryption can't be secure for many applications.
%
The second thread starts from generic secure multi-party computation and
optimizes solutions for common database tasks. This approach requires redesign
of database indexing mechanisms and results in better security at the cost of
decreased efficiency. 
%
We note that so far, both approaches offer only the {\em limited functionality
of SQL and NoSQL}. 

\paragraph{Proposed work.}
Emerging databases include large scale graph databases, analytic databases, and
biometric databases. These databases share a fundamental operation: {\em
computing distance/proximity of tuples of points}. The proposed research will
consider proximity queries as a case study and give constructions supporting
these queries. 

To show the promise of this approach, we will first show that for many metric
spaces, the ideal object for distance-preserving encryption has a weaker
security requirement than that for order-preserving encryption, thereby opening
the door to more customized, efficient constructions. Then, we will give
customized schemes of property-preserving encryption for distance/proximity. 

In addition, we will also attempt a third approach to encrypted search for
proximity which lies between property-preserving encryption and multi-party
computation (MPC) based approaches. The resulting constructions will have
better security than the property-preserving encryption schemes and better
efficiency than MPC-based schemes. In particular, the proposed approach will
use standard database indexing mechanisms but (interactively) involve the
client to help with sensitive operations. This approach has been used in the
context of order-preserving encryption, and we will extend these techniques to
{\em handle distance queries and dynamic data}.

Lastly, the proposed research will improve existing constructions to have
better security by reducing the leakage and providing forward security.  

%To show the promise of this approach, the proposed research will first give
%constructions for the proximity functionality of the two standard approaches.
%
%and show that for many metric spaces, the ideal object for distance-preserving
%encryption computation has a different characteristic from that for the
%order-preserving encryption,   
%
%Furthermore, we will extend multi-party computation based techniques.  We
%expect unacceptable overhead in networks with realistic latency.  

\paragraph{Intellectual merits.}  
Encrypted databases and searchable encryption has a rich history rooted in the
design of oblivious random access machines.  The current landscape is littered
with approaches with uncertain security or inadequate functionality.  Recent
leakage inference attacks have taught us the impact of leakage and forward
security.  At the same time, the rapid deployment of property-preserving
techniques has reinforced the importance of simplicity, efficiency and backward
compatibility.  These two developments inform the core of our approach: using
interactivity to strengthen property-preserving encryption.

\paragraph{Broader impacts.}
The confidentiality of data is a core societal tenant.  Deployed encrypted
databases provide little security and may even hurt by providing a false sense
of security.  There is a tremendous need for research in this area to
understand the tradeoffs between security, functionality, and efficiency.

The PIs are committed to broad dissemination of research material.  The PIs
have participated in large scale evaluation of searchable encryption, working
on both constructions and attacks.  Furthermore, the PIs have open-sourced
previous work including work on searchable encryption.  Lastly, all PIs are
dedicated to engaging with undergraduates, with two co-PIs being at an
undergraduate only institution, the US Naval Academy.
