\subsection{Extending BlindSeer}

\paragraph{Overview of BlindSeer.}
Roughly speaking, BlindSeer~\cite{SP:PKVKMC14,SP:FVKKKM15} has three main
players. The {\em server} $\sf S$, who holds the DB and hands an encrypted copy
of the DB to a third party, called the {\em index server} $\sf IS$. The server
$\sf S$  also builds an encrypted Bloom filter (BF) tree index to the DB and
sends it to $\sf IS$. The {\em client} $\sf C$ sends search queries to $\sf IS$
and obtained encrypted results, to each of which $\sf C$ obtains the decryption
key secret-shared by $\sf S$ and $\sf IS$. 

BlindSeer provides the following privacy guarantees:
\begin{itemize}
\item Query privacy: $\sf S$ is not involved with the search protocol at all,
the client's queries are hidden from $\sf S$. Moreover, $\sf IS$ holds only the
{\em encrypted} database, the client's queries remain private to a great
degree. 

\item Data privacy: $\sf IS$ deals with only the encrypted database, so the
records are hidden from $\sf IS$. Moreover, $\sf IS$ returns only the records
that satisfy the client query, and therefore, $\sf C$ cannot arbitrarily access
all the records in the database.  
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Proposed Work}

\paragraph{Adapting Blindseer to a simpler cloud setting.}
When a database is outsourced, the database owner is often the client itself.
In this case, we don't need to worry about data privacy against the client, and
we can significantly simplify the architecture of the Blindseer system. 

\begin{itemize}
\item {\em Much more efficient setup and record retrieval.}
The client plays as both $\sf S$ and $\sf C$ in the original setting. The
client can just hold one symmetric key to decrypt all the records. Before, in
order to use secret-sharing, a slow public-key encryption scheme and a random
shuffling must be introduced in the setup and record-retrieval phase, none of
which we need in the current setting. 

\item {\em MPC is not necessary.} In the original Blindseer system, in order to
hide from $\sf C$ the BF data in each node of the BF tree, $\sf C$ and $\sf IS$
have to execute costly MPC computation. In the current setting, the client can
simply ask for the encrypted data from the cloud server and decrypt it. 

\item {\em Dynamic record insertion.} In the original BlindSeer, it was
difficult to insert the BF index to the BF tree dynamically, since it will
cause the BF tree to have a more complicated encryption structure and the MPC
computation to be much more costly. In the current setting, since MPC is not necessary, this opportunity of adding BF indices directly to the BF tree is widely open. 
\end{itemize}

We believe that it is important to provide an efficient solution for various
use case scenarios. Given the appropriate use case, simplified version provide
the solution running {\em at least x5 faster than the original system}.  

\paragraph{Supporting a rich set of functionalities.}
We note that BlindSeer provides a rich set of functionality including
conjunctions and range query. 

*** to do: write about how to support conjunctions and range query?

Based on this, we can support various types of queries. 
\begin{itemize}
\item Spatial data. A query that searches for the points $(x, y)$ in DB that
belongs to a 2D square defined by the top-left point $(x_1, y_1)$ and the
bottom-right point $(y_1, y_2)$ can be described with range queries and conjunctions as follows:
  $$ x_1 \le x \le x_2 ~~{\sf AND}~~~ y_1 \le y \le y_2 $$

\item ***to do: What else? 
\end{itemize}
