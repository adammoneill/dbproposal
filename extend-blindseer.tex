\subsection{Extending BlindSeer}

\paragraph{Prior work.} A co-PI was a member of the team that developed
BlindSeer~\cite{SP:PKVKMC14,SP:FVKKKM15}, which is a database management system
that provides privacy.

Roughly speaking, BlindSeer has three main players. The {\em server} $\sf S$,
who holds the DB and outsources an encrypted copy of the DB to a third party,
called the {\em index server} $\sf IS$. The server $\sf S$  also builds an
encrypted Bloom filter (BF) tree index to the DB and sends it to $\sf IS$. The
{\em client} $\sf C$ sends search queries to $\sf IS$ and obtained encrypted
results, to each of which $\sf C$ obtains the decryption key secret-shared
between $\sf C$ and $\sf IS$. The decryptions keys are arranged in the offline
setup stage, using the techniques of shuffling and homomorphic public-key
encryption.
%
BlindSeer provides the following privacy guarantees:
\begin{itemize}
\item Query privacy: Since $\sf S$ is not involved with the search protocol at
  all, the client's queries are hidden from $\sf S$. Moreover, $\sf IS$ holds
    the {\em shuffled, encrypted} database, so the client's queries remain
    private to a great degree against $\sf IS$. 

\item Data privacy: $\sf IS$ deals with only the encrypted database, so the
records are hidden from $\sf IS$. Moreover, $\sf IS$ returns only the records
that satisfy the client query, and therefore, $\sf C$ cannot arbitrarily access
all the records in the database.  
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Proposed Work}

\paragraph{Better efficiency and funciontionality in a simpler cloud
setting.} When a database is outsourced, the database owner is often the client
itself, in which case we don't need to worry about whether the plaintext data
would be leaked to the client.  In this proposal, we will consider this setting
of the client as the data owner and significantly simplify the architecture of
the Blindseer system. This will bring us a construction that has better
efficiency and a richer set of functionalities. In particular,

\begin{itemize}
\item {\em Much simpler, efficient setup.}
In this new simpler setting, the client can be regarded as playing as both $\sf
 S$ and $\sf C$ in the original BlindSeer architecture. Therefore, in order
 that he may decrypt all the records, the client can just hold one symmetric
 key in constrast to the original BlindSeer system where a slow public-key
 encryption scheme and a random shuffling must be introduced in the setup
 stage, none of which we need in our new setting. 

\item {\em MPC is not necessary.} In the original Blindseer system, in order to
hide from $\sf C$ the BF indices stored in each node of the indexing tree, $\sf
C$ and $\sf IS$ have to execute costly MPC computation. In our setting, the
client can simply ask for the necessary encrypted BF indices and decrypt
them, since we don't need to hide anything from the client.  


\item {\em Dynamic record insertion.} In the original BlindSeer, one cannot
insert new encrypted BF indices to the indexing tree dynamically.  It is mainly
because the decryption key for each record must be arranged in the setup
stage.
%
Furthermore, in the original BlindSeer, BF indices are encrypted with a very
    simple mechanism of one-time pad so that MPC computation may be reasonably
    efficient. Dynamic addtion of BF indices will lead to a more complicated
    encryption structure, and the MPC computation will be much more costly.

In our setting, however, we don't need any key setup, nor MPC comutation.
Therefore, we can add BF indices directly to the indexing tree with much more
efficiency.  
\end{itemize}

We believe that it is important to provide an efficient solution for various
settings. For use cases where this new setting is appropriate, our simplified
construction will provide a solution running {\em at least x10 faster than the
original system}.  

\paragraph{Proximity of high-dimentional data.}
BlindSeer already provides conjunctions and range queries, based on which we
can support the funcitonality of proximity in a Euclidean space. 
In particular, a query that searches for the points $(x, y)$ in DB that belongs
to a 2D rectangle defined by the top-left point $(x_1, y_1)$ and the
bottom-right point $(y_1, y_2)$ can be described with range queries and
conjunctions as follows: $$ x_1 \le x \le x_2 ~~{\sf AND}~~~ y_1 \le y \le y_2.
$$ This techinque can be easily extended to data with multiple dimensions.
