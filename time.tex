\section{Component B:  Property-Preserving Encryption for Time Series Data} 

In time series data one is often interested in correlations and anomalies.  Accordingly, we propose to look at \emph{correlation revealing and preserving encryption}  (CRE and CPE) and \emph{anomaly revealing and preserving encryption} (ARE and APE).  In other words, in the ``preserving'' case we are interested in perturbing statistical data in a way that preserves statistics or the fact that a point is an anomaly.  

Regarding correlation revealing schemes
\begin{question}
Can we design efficient CPE for correlations of interest?  Which correlations should we target?  What security can be achieved by such schemes?
\end{question}


\begin{question}
Can we design efficient CRE with better security?
\end{question}

\begin{question}
Can we design ``partial'' CPE with better security?
\end{question}


Regarding anomaly  evealing schemes
\begin{question}
Can we design efficient APE?  How should anomaly thresholds be set?  What security can be achieved by such schemes?
\end{question}


\begin{question}
Can we design efficient ARE with better security?
\end{question}

\begin{question}
Can we design ``partial'' APE with better security?
\end{question}
