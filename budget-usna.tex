{\LARGE Budget Justification for USNA}
\end{center}

\paragraph{Salary}
The United States Naval Academy (USNA) is an undergraduate only
institution, and as such, summer support is requested such that the
senior personal can be the primary personnel in complete this
research.  

The co-PIs Choi and Roche request 1 month of summer support for three years. 

\paragraph{Fringe Benefits}
USNA requests a 33\% acceleration rate as a fringe benefit to pay for salary
costs (e.g., health care) over the summer not covered by annual salary. 

\paragraph{Overhead}
USNA takes a 10\% overhead on direct costs under the ``de minimis'' clause.
Direct costs include labor and travel but not equipment/supplies. 

\paragraph{Travel}
As part of the outreach effort of this proposal, travel is request at
a level of \$4,000 per year for domestic travel.
