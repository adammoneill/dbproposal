\subsection{Component C-III: Enhancing security of BlindSeer}

In Blindseer, the search query is executed by the client traversing the BF
search tree. In particular, in each node of the tree, the client and the server
execute the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\item For each keyword $\alpha$ in the query, the client computes the hash
function $H(\alpha)$ to identify the BF indices $(h_1, h_2, ..., h_\eta)$ where
$\eta$ is a system parameter. The client sends $(h_1, h_2, \ldots, h_\eta)$ to
the server. 

\item The client and the server execute a protocol so that the client may know
whether the BF bits for the indices $(h_1, h_2, \ldots, h_\eta)$ are set, based
on which the client decides whether to proceed based on the result.
\end{enumerate}

Note this leakage $(h_1, \ldots, h_\eta)$ is per keyword in the query. Based on
this leakage, the server can infer whether two queries contain the same keyword
with decent probability. 


to do: ORAM to hide this leakage
