\subsection{Enhancing security of BlindSeer}

In BlindSeer, the search query is executed by the client traversing the Bloom filter
search tree. In particular, in each node of the tree, the client and the server
execute the following:

\begin{enumerate}\setlength\itemsep{0em}
\item For each keyword $\alpha$ in the query, the client computes a hash on
$\alpha$, based on which the look-up positions $H(\alpha) =  (h_1, h_2, ...,
h_\eta)$ for the BF data are identified. Here, $\eta$ is a system
parameter. 

\item Let $\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_q$ be the keywords used in the query.  The
  client sends $\HHH = \{H(\alpha_1), \ldots, H(\alpha_q)\}$ to the server. 

\item The client and the server execute a protocol using $\HHH$ and the
encrypted BF as input, so that the client knows whether the given query is
satisfied. 
\end{enumerate}

The message $\HHH$ (i.e., the look-up positions) from the client to the server
leaks $H(\alpha)$ to a significantly degree, since $q$ is a small number most
of the time. Moreover, $H(\alpha)$ is a deterministic function on $\alpha$.
This implies that the server can infer with a reasonable probability whether
two queries contain the same keyword, although it doesn't know what the keyword
is.  If the server is given  auxiliary information about query statistics, the
server may be able to infer queries. 

%\paragraph{Removing the leakage of BF indices.}

It is difficult to reduce the leakage in the original
BlindSeer system. In particular, the above step 3 (i.e., the protocol execution
to check whether the given query is satisfied) is performed using secure
two-party computation based on Yao's garbled circuit. It is critical
for the logic to be as simple as possible, in order to obtain the desired
efficiency. To reduce the leakage, it is natural to use more sophisticated
cryptographic mechanisms, but then the step 3 of secure computation would be
significantly slower. 

However, in Section~\ref{sec:ext-blindseer} we noted secure computation is not
necessary in the two-party setting. In this case, we can actually remove the
leakage by completely hiding $\HHH$. As one promising direction, we can achive
this goal by storing the encrypted BF using ORAM techniques. Note that the
$\HHH$ can be regarded as the metadata (i.e., ``addresses") for the encrypted
data (i.e., BF contents), which fits perfectly into the scneario that ORAM
tries to make secure. 
%
Even using the ORAM, we expect that the resulting system will be faster than
the system using two-party secure computation, since two-party computation is
known to be significantly slower than ORAM.
